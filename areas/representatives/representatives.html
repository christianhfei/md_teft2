          <p>A representative is a person who you approved with your supports planner to help manage your health information and services. You are not required to have a representative and not all participants have a representative. Contact your supports planner if you have questions about your representative. <strong>By allowing your representative to access the MyLTSS system, they will have all of the same abilities as you to review your service information.</strong></p>
